<h2 class = 'head2'>Bangladesh to USA</h2>
<p> One of the biggest dreams of many, many Bangladesh residents is to go to
a prosperous nation (USA, especially), and start a life that's filled with prosperous promises. My life back in Bangladesh
was filled with financial burdens and difficulties, and fortunately my family and I 
have been granted the opportunity to immigrate to the United States. Adapting to such a change in enviornment
was certainly not easy, however with the help of our relatives, we managed to settle in. </p>

<h2 class = 'head2'> Life in the US</h2>
<p>One flawed thinking that Bangladesh residents and I <em>used to</em> believe is that America is simply a place where
money just happens to conveniently <em>grow on trees</em> for you. After living in the US for nearly 10 years, 
I have certainly changed my perception of America. Without hard work and dedication, a successful life 
will cease to exist. I changed who I used to be, I now grasped the concept of dedication, and I have
put relentless effort to do the best that I can. Numerous successful people, have histories of 
struggles and failures. Frankly, if there's one thing that I learned in these 10 years,
it's that failure exists not to bring one down, but to teach one to get up. </p>
