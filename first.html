    <h2> Early Life </h2>
    
    <p> I was born and raised in <span title = "Located in the north-east region of Bangladesh." > <em>Sylhet, Bangladesh</em></span> - a third world country. 
    Needless to say, poverty and famine reigned through the cities and villages. Infrastructure as a whole was either dilapidated
    or flat-out neglected. The country not only suffered economical and political quandaries, 
    but also, unnecessary belligerence: murder, robbery, assaults, and  corruption. All too 
    common. However, despite these predicaments, it didn't exactly eliminate the thrill and fun,
    especially in the countryside. It is because of a lack of technology, that we bonded with nature 
    and amongst ourselves. </p>

<h2> Culture </h2>

<p> Growing up in Bangladesh, the majority of the people devoted their religious faith to Islam.
My family and I are in that category, and like other religions, we have certain rules and beliefs, that
must be followed. The principles of Islam can be broken down into five pillars: Shahada (confession of faith),
Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity), sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, if financially possible). 
These are the major criteria of a Muslim person. It should be noted that Islam is a religion that strictly
supports peace and harmony amongst mankind.
