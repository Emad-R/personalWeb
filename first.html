        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in <span title="Located in the north-east region of Bangladesh."><em>Sylhet, Bangladesh</em></span> - a third-world country. 
        Needless to say, poverty and famine reigned through the cities and villages. Infrastructure as a whole was either dilapidated
        or flat-out neglected. The country not only suffered economical and political quandaries, 
        but also, unnecessary belligerence: murder, robbery, assaults, and corruption. All too common. However, despite these predicaments,
        it didn't exactly eliminate the thrill and fun, especially in the countryside. It is because of a lack of technology that we bonded
        with nature and amongst ourselves.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Growing up in Bangladesh, the majority of the people devoted their religious faith to Islam.
        My family and I are in that category, and like other religions, we have certain rules and beliefs that must be followed.
        The principles of Islam can be broken down into five pillars: Shahada (confession of faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity),
        sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, if financially possible). These are the major criteria of a Muslim person.
        It should be noted that Islam is a religion that strictly supports peace and harmony amongst mankind.</p>
